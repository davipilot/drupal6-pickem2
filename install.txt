
1. Enable Forum (from core)
2. Enable Pickem (this module)
3. Add a Forum for league banter.
4. Add a Standard Page/Story/Node or a Forum Post for an explanation of the rules of the league, and remember the node id of the post.
5. Add a League (/admin/content/pickem/leagues) and choose the linked forum and the Rules node id from 5.
6. Add users to the league (admin/content/pickem/league_users) 
This user will then see the league menus under "My leagues".

That's about it.  Enjoy.
